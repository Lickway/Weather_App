# HOMEWORK: Practice with Array Methods and APIs!!

[introduction, clever gifs]

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

### Part One

- See instructions in the [methods markdown](./methods/)

### Part Two

- See instructions in the [API markdown](./api/)

### Part Three

- This part is easy. Read the article [What Screens Want](https://www.frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/). This is pre-reading for Responsive Design later this week, but we'd like you to have a couple days to digest it. (It's an older article -- written around the time iOS switched to the flat design aesthetic in 2013 -- but still _extremely_ relevant.)

## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- An issue ticket created on the repo `ada-students` [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-ada/ada-students/issues/new)
- A link to your fork of this repository
- A link to the bitballoon upload of your weather app
- One thing you found interesting from the article
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 11PM ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT ðŸš¨
