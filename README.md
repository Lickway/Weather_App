This is a bigger homework. Take your time, work through all the parts thoroughly. You can make it!! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

You've completed all three parts of the homework:

### Part Three: Reading and viewing!

- ðŸš¨ Do this Tuesday night!!!! ðŸš¨ Watch the [event loop video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ). It's about 25 minutes and will lead into Wednesday's lecture.
- Read the article [The Web's Grain](https://www.frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/) (one of my favorite articles...). This is pre-reading for Responsive Design later this week, but we'd like you to have a couple days to digest it. (If you really like that article, [this one](https://www.frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/) is also very amazing.)
