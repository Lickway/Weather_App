# HOMEWORK: Practice with Array Methods and APIs!!

[introduction, clever gifs]

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

### Part One

- See instructions in the [methods markdown](./methods/)

### Part Two

- See instructions in the [API markdown](./api/)

### Part Three

- This part is easy. Read the article [The Web's Grain](https://www.frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/) (one of my favorite articles...). This is pre-reading for Responsive Design later this week, but we'd like you to have a couple days to digest it. (If you really like that article, [this one](https://www.frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/) is also very amazing.)

## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- An issue ticket created on the repo `ada-students` [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-ada/ada-students/issues/new)
- A link to your fork of this repository
- A link to the bitballoon upload of your weather app
- One thing you found interesting from the article
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 11PM ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT!! ðŸš¨

This is a bigger homework, we know. Take your time, work through all the parts thoroughly. You can make it!! Maybe work on getting the methods homework all done on Tuesday night and then leaving Wednesday to tackle the API homework... ðŸ¤”
