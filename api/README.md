# Building a weather app!!

Here's an exciting challenge: You'll be building a small weather app, using your newfound skills with APIs!


### Your page should have:
- An input field for a user to enter a zip code
- A submit button
- When the submit button is clicked:
    - A GET request should fetch the weather data from the API
    - The following data should be rendered on the page:
        - City name
        - Current temperature
        - Weather description
        - Min temp
        - Max temp
- **BONUS**: Have the temperature turn blue if under 40, and red if above 90.

Here are some zip codes to test!
- 99501 (Anchorage)
- 99723 (Barrow, AK)
- 60605 (Chicago)
- 70124 (New Orleans)
- 77030 (Houston, TX)
- 00902 (San Juan, Puerto Rico)
- 46923 (Delphi, IN)
- 94123 (San Francisco, CA)
